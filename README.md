# nand2tetris
Projects completed from the nand2tetris course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

The course involved implementing the hardware and software hierarchy of a general-purpose 16-bit computer. This included implementation of the chip-set as well as an assembler, stack-based virtual machine translator, compiler for a high-level object-oriented programming language, and simple operating system to close the gaps between the software stack and bare-bone hardware platform.

<b>Project 1:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01<br>
Implementation of a set of logic gates using NAND gates as the primitive chip. (Implemented in a Hardware Description Language (HDL))

<b>Project 2:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project02<br>
Implementation of more complex chips leading up to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). (HDL)

<b>Project 3:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project03<br>
Implementation of memory chips leading up to the Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. (HDL)

<b>Project 4:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project04<br>
Implementation of 2 programs written in assembly. One to demonstrate simple multiplication and one to demonstration low-level I/O handling. (Assembly)

<b>Project 5:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project05<br>
Implementation of the final hardware platform, incorporating the chips implemented in the previous projects (above). (HDL)

<b>Project 6:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06<br>
Implementation of an assembler to translate programs written in the assembly language into binary code that can be executed on the hardware platform. (Python)

<b>Project 7:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project07<br>
Implementation of a stack-based virtual machine translator, handling only arithmetic and memory access commands (to be extended in project 8). (Java)

<b>Project 8:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project08<br>
Implementation of final stack-based virtual machine translator which translates programs written in an intermediate/VM language into assembly code. (Java)

<b>Project 9:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project09<br>
Implementation of a sliding puzzle game written in the Jack programming language. (Jack)

<b>Project 10:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project10<br>
Implementation of a syntax analyser which parses programs written in Jack according to the grammer rules, and subsequently renders the program's structure in the form of an XML document. (Java)<br>
Note: This project was completed in 2 stages:
- Stage 1 involved implementing and testing a tokeniser service to be used by the parser.
- Stage 2 (referred to as project10) builds upon Stage 1 and comprises the final implementation as described above.

<b>Project 11:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project11<br>
Implementation of a compiler to translate programs written in the Jack programming language into the intermediate/VM language which can be run on the virtual machine implemented in project8. This projects extends/builds upon project 10. (Java)<br>
Note: This project was completed in 2 stages:
- Stage 1 involved implementing and testing a symbol table module and using it to extend the syntax analyser built in project 10.
- Stage 2 (referred to as project11) builds upon Stage 1 and comprises the final implementation of the compiler, complete with code generation functionality.

<b>Project 12:</b> https://www.nand2tetris.org/project12<br>
Implementation of an operating system in the Jack programming language to facilitate the execution of programs on the computer platform. (Jack)
